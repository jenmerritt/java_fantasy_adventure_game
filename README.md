# java_fantasy_adventure_game
This was developed whilst studying at CodeClan as a weekend homework (3 days).

The aim was to practice inheritance, interfaces, TDD and writing Java Classes.

I loosely modelled on the world of Pokemon to give some structure / ideas to work to.

## Summary of the Brief given:

The task is to model a fantasy adventure. The game will have players, who will have a number of health points and weapons/spells.

### MVP
- Create the players and rooms for the adventure. (Don't worry about giving the rooms any exits.)
- Give different players properties/methods that are specific to their own class. (e.g. a Knight could have armour that could reduce damage they take)
- The user should complete rooms by either collecting treasure or defeating an enemy and a new room will be presented to them.
### Extensions
- Create a Quest for the players to work through. Possibly a collection of rooms to go through and the quest completes when all rooms are completed
- Expand any other way you wish.
